      <title>Futures in Rust</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rust-lang.org&#34;&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago but didn&amp;rsquo;t really bother to&#xA;learn it. The ecosystem was tiny, the language seemed to be of little practical use and it was&#xA;bothersome to get my head around its quirks like borrowing and lifetimes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But things have changed. With growing interest and a fast-evolving ecosystem, the language is&#xA;impossible to ignore. Go&amp;rsquo;s goroutines and Scala&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;Future&lt;/code&gt;s had really spoiled me and I really&#xA;needed something similar. Then I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alexcrichton/futures-rs/&#34;&gt;futures&lt;/a&gt;,&#xA;a zero-cost futures and streams Rust library. And I thought of making a simple async web API&#xA;wrapper as my first Rust project and a blog post to go along as a tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lots of libraries offer interfaces in C mainly to be universally callable from&#xA;any programming language. This is absolutely fantastic! It lets any language&#xA;with a FFI (Foreign Function Interface) to hook into and use a large number of&#xA;C libraries. But the downsides? The code is verbose, memory needs to be manually&#xA;managed and it&amp;rsquo;s really easy to forget the crucial bits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;C++, being extremely close to C, can easily call into a C library if needed.&#xA;And the vice-verse is also true if &lt;code&gt;extern &amp;quot;C&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt; is used (instruct the compiler&#xA;to not mangle function names). So, should you even go through the trouble of&#xA;wrapping it in C++? If so, what&amp;rsquo;s a good way to do it? This post explores these&#xA;questions and offers an insight into the hell called cross-language&#xA;interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Ishbir Singh and I hate writing About pages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who are you?&amp;rdquo; Wish I could satisfactorily answer that. A better question&#xA;would be: what do you like to do? I like to learn, experience, travel and live.&#xA;I work to learn and not vice-versa. I&amp;rsquo;m curious about people and their stories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand. Where does programming fit in?&amp;rdquo; you ask. I look at&#xA;machines and picture the humans behind them: their motivation, story and&#xA;goals. Software for me isn&amp;rsquo;t just lines of code. It&amp;rsquo;s a piece of art; a story&#xA;waiting to be discovered and written. It is with this attitude that I work on&#xA;any project: 100% of emotional and intellectual dedication. I am invested in&#xA;the success of not only my project, but also of the organization behind it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
