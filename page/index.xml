      <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Ishbir Singh and I hate writing About pages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who are you?&amp;rdquo; Wish I could satisfactorily answer that. A better question&#xA;would be: what do you like to do? I like to learn, experience, travel and live.&#xA;I work to learn and not vice-versa. I&amp;rsquo;m curious about people and their stories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand. Where does programming fit in?&amp;rdquo; you ask. I look at&#xA;machines and picture the humans behind them: their motivation, story and&#xA;goals. Software for me isn&amp;rsquo;t just lines of code. It&amp;rsquo;s a piece of art; a story&#xA;waiting to be discovered and written. It is with this attitude that I work on&#xA;any project: 100% of emotional and intellectual dedication. I am invested in&#xA;the success of not only my project, but also of the organization behind it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
