&lt;p&gt;My name is Ishbir Singh and I hate writing About pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Who are you?&amp;rdquo; Wish I could satisfactorily answer that. A better question
would be: what do you like to do? I like to learn, experience, travel and live.
I work to learn and not vice-versa. I&amp;rsquo;m curious about people and their stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand. Where does programming fit in?&amp;rdquo; you ask. I look at
machines and picture the humans behind them: their motivation, story and
goals. Software for me isn&amp;rsquo;t just lines of code. It&amp;rsquo;s a piece of art; a story
waiting to be discovered and written. It is with this attitude that I work on
any project: 100% of emotional and intellectual dedication. I am invested in
the success of not only my project, but also of the organization behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My technological interests change every few years but right now, they are:
machine learning and natural language processing. In the past they&amp;rsquo;ve included
crypto-currencies, cybersecurity, hardware hacking, distributed and
peer-to-peer systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-d-i-start-this-blog&#34;&gt;Why&amp;rsquo;d I start this blog?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt like I needed a place to put together all my programming research and
improve my writing skills. What better way than to blog about it? Hopefully it
would help someone with their own endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, a blog is an excellent marketing tool. :-)&lt;/p&gt;
